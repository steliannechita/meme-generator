## Meme generator

Meme generator is a simple web application that fetches data (random images) from an API (https://api.imgflip.com) and allows user to add text captions to established memes and changing the font size.

### Challenges
The most challenging thing was to make the app responsive (I have managed to do that by using flex-box and CSS -'position' property).

### Future features

- Allow users to download the created  meme  on their personal device

### Technologies used
- React.JS 
- JavaScript (ES6) 
- Node.JS
- Asynchronous JS
- fetch API
- CSS 
- HTML5 
- Git 
- GitHub
- GitHub Pages
